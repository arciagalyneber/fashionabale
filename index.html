					<p >Make-up can be viewed as frivolous, but there are key moments when its power to bring confidence to the wearer should not be underestimated. Here, model and philanthropist Petra Němcová discusses the role of beauty in her own powerful and inspiring story, after her life was changed forever.In the latest episode from Vogue’s video series, in partnership with Max Factor, we meet Petra Němcová, a Czech philanthropist and model and one of the Max Factor Voices – a diverse collective of 11 inspirational women from around the world whose life experiences have shaped their attitudes to beauty.The success of the fashion trends lies in the way the society intyerprets the fashion trend and judge it.
					Hence the impact is measured by the barometer of the social acceptance which is driven by the several motivational forces that underlines the peoples values and behavioral traits.
					Today's consumer culture is driven by aspirationalism that diminishes the gap between the rich and economically volatile sections when it comes to accepting and adopting a trend. 
					
					IS A STATEMENT. NOT A STYLE. FASHION DOES NOT HAVE TO BE WORN CASUALLY. NOR OUTSIDE THE RUNWAY. FASHION IS FIR FOR ALL PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. FASHION IS AN ART OF PROFESSIONALS, SELF-EXPRESSION. POPULAR ON CHARISTMATIC.

					provition of communication signals such as posible cues about his/her social stature value and lifestyle Fashion,comminication has under gone a 360 degree shift in its communicable aspects

						<p> Fashion trends come and go: meanwhile a society's values are established and evolving characteristic
						to their beliefs and culture. Fashion is just not an ambitious projected image of a reinterpreted good value 
						to fullfill some function or agenda alike but rather a evocative and refreshing concept worthy to be portrayed 
						fo society's appreciation that makes us even more instinctive. In the society , the individual's apperance
						is the ticket to transmit non verbal.</p>

				<p>Instagram likes are now a serious metric for investors in luxury brands including Burberry, Kering-owned Gucci and Saint Laurent and LVMH labels including Dior and Louis Vuitton.

Posts on the millennial-friendly platform are likely to lead to sales, according to a UBS report on European luxury published Friday.

"Given the rising importance of social media for luxury brands — especially in the context of millennials growth — we believe Instagram data can no longer be ignored as a data point for luxury investors, to help them pick the winning brands," the report's authors said.

The number of Instagram followers a luxury brand has is likely to correlate to sales. "We note a clear linear relation between the number of followers on a given social channel and the brand sales at retail," UBS notes. Even if fans can't afford to buy a designer item immediately, their interest will likely mean they purchase "sooner or later."</p>
